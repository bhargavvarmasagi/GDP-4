Challenge:- 
**The current grocery delivery management system at Maryville is ineffective since it mostly relies on labor-intensive manual methods which can go wrong and cause delays. Order administration, tracking, communication and customer satisfaction are all severely hampered by this method.<br>**

Errors can occur when orders are taken and recorded manually. These errors can include missing orders, inaccurate order details, and lost information. In addition to having a negative effect on the accuracy of the service, this also makes the order management procedure sluggish, which negatively impacts client satisfaction.<br>

Lack of a centralized system makes it hard for delivery staff to coordinate and communicate with each other. Phone conversations and written notes are common ways that instructions are conveyed, and they can easily result in misunderstandings, during busy times of the day. The distribution process becomes even more difficult as a result of delays, inaccurate deliveries, and wasteful resource usage.<br>

Customers and management are not able to view the status of deliveries due to the lack of real-time monitoring. While the administration finds it hard to give accurate updates, this lack of transparency forces customers to place continuous follow-up calls to know about the status of their orders. Customers and the company alike become irritated with the delays in communication and tracking.<br>

The current approach relies on follow-up calls made during consecutive orders or after the delivery, with no systematic means of gathering and analyzing customer feedback. This unstructured, and belated approach to feedback collection results in missed chances for enhancement and endless problems that could have been resolved sooner. The inconsistent feedback management further degrades the general quality of the offered service.
