**1. Performance**
- **Order Processing Speed:** Orders should be processed within 2-3 seconds to ensure a seamless user experience, including verifying inventory availability through store API integrations.
- **Search and Filtering:** The product catalog search and filtering functionality should return results to enhance usability.
- **Load Balancing:** The system should support load balancing during peak ordering times, with no more than a 5% drop in response time even during high traffic periods.
- **API Response Time:** Integrated APIs should respond and to avoid delays in order placement.

**2. Security**
- **PCI Compliance:** All payment processing must follow PCI-DSS standards to ensure secure handling of customer payment information.
- **Data Encryption:** Personal and order data must be encrypted using **AES-256** both during transmission and at rest to protect sensitive information.
- **Authentication & Access Control:** The system must implement role-based access control to ensure that only authorized personnel can access sensitive features (e.g., delivery tracking, payment data).

**3. Availability**
- **System Uptime:** The system should maintain an availability of *99.9*, ensuring it is operational during critical times such as peak grocery shopping hours.
- **Redundancy:** There should be redundancy for critical components, including payment processing and order tracking, to avoid service interruptions.

**4. Scalability**
- **Horizontal Scalability:** The system should scale horizontally to handle up to 10,000 concurrent users without degradation in performance, 
ensuring smooth service during peak periods.

**5. Usability**
- **Mobile Optimization:** The interface should be fully responsive and optimized for mobile devices, allowing users to seamlessly browse, order, and track deliveries on mobile phones and tablets.
- **Ease of Use:** The user interface (UI) should be intuitive, with no more than 3 clicks required for a user to place an order or track their delivery.
