**Non-Functional Requirements List (Iteration 2)**

**1. Performance**
- **Order Processing Speed:** Orders should be processed within 2-3 seconds to ensure a seamless user experience, including verifying inventory availability through store API integrations.
- **Search and Filtering:** The product catalog search and filtering functionality should return results to enhance usability.
- **Load Balancing:** The system should support load balancing during peak ordering times, with no more than a 5% drop in response time even during high traffic periods.
- **API Response Time:**  Integrated APIs should respond within an acceptable time frame to avoid delays in order placement and ensure a smooth user experience.

**2. Security**
- **Data Encryption:** Personal and order data must be encrypted using **AES-256** both during transmission and at rest to protect sensitive information.

**3. Availability**
- **System Uptime:** The system should maintain an availability of *99.9*, ensuring it is operational during critical times such as peak grocery shopping hours.

**4. Scalability**
- **Horizontal Scalability:** The system should scale horizontally to handle up to 10,000 concurrent users without degradation in performance, 
ensuring smooth service during peak periods.

**5. Usability**
- **Mobile Optimization:** The interface should be fully responsive and optimized for mobile devices, allowing users to seamlessly browse, order, and track deliveries on mobile phones and tablets.
- **Ease of Use:** The user interface (UI) should be intuitive, with no more than 3 clicks required for a user to place an order or track their delivery.

**6. Stability**
- **Fault Tolerance:** The system should handle faults in one component (e.g., payment processing) without affecting the rest of the application, ensuring continuous operation.

**7. Real-Time Tracking**
- **GPS Update Frequency:** GPS tracking of delivery personnel should update in real-time, with location data refreshed every 10 seconds for accuracy.
- **Tracking Dashboard:** A real-time dashboard should be provided to both customers and management for delivery status monitoring, with updates provided within 2 seconds of receiving new data.

**8. Customer Feedback and Reviews**
- **Analytics Dashboard:** An analytics dashboard should provide management with real-time insights into user feedback, including common complaints and satisfaction trends.

**9. Compliance**
- **Data Retention Policies:** The system should define clear data retention policies, with customer data being securely deleted after 12 months unless otherwise needed for operational purposes.

**10. Maintainability**
- **Modular Code Structure:** The app should be designed with modularity in mind, allowing developers to update or replace individual components (e.g., payment gateway, order tracking) without disrupting the entire system.
